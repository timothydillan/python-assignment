Libraries needed to be installed:
Pygame = https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation
Self = https://pypi.org/project/self/
Copy = https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html
Shelve = https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html

To run the game, open your command prompt and change your directory to the game's directory (using cd "folder path").

Then after changing the directory, on the same command prompt, type python main.py

After every game, an event log text file will be generated named gameLog.txt in the same folder.

Other than that, after saving the game, there will be a file called firstFantasia.db in which the data is stored there.
